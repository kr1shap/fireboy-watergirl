# Fireboy and Watergirl (Java Swing Implementation)

A custom implementation of the classic **Fireboy and Watergirl** puzzle-platformer, built entirely with the `javax.swing` library. This project recreates the mechanics of the original game with multiple levels, cooperative character control, collectible diamonds, and enemies.
